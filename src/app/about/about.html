        Box Walks is a registered charity which develops sustainability-themed, adventure walks using Britain's grade II listed phone boxes as destination points. The phone boxes unlock gamified content and activities.
      </p>
      <p class="text-base mb-16 leading-relaxed" style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif; font-weight: 300;">
        Our vision is to bring our urban grade II listed phone boxes out of retirement, and once again use them to create connection and community. Only this time, amplifying their reach to reflect our modern world.

        What we do
      </h3>
      <p class="text-base mb-6 leading-relaxed" style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif; font-weight: 300;">
        We protect and maintain Britain's grade II listed phone boxes, preserving our architectural and cultural heritage, while ensuring future generations can enjoy them.
      </p>
      <p class="text-base mb-6 leading-relaxed" style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif; font-weight: 300;">
        We enable communities to come together - walk, get fit and make new friends – while enjoying and interacting with what the borough has to offer.
      </p>
      <p class="text-base mb-16 leading-relaxed" style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif; font-weight: 300;">
        We accelerate environmental action by providing our communities with activities they can complete to reduce their environmental footprint, while collecting points and competing with others.

        How we do it
      </h3>
      <p class="text-base mb-6 leading-relaxed" style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif; font-weight: 300;">
        We buy and lease the phone boxes, and make sure these are maintained and kept in good condition. We preserve the integrity of all our phone boxes by holding the content relating to our walks and activities on our Box Walks app.
      </p>
      <p class="text-base mb-16 leading-relaxed" style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif; font-weight: 300;">
        Everyone can download the Box Walks app for free, set up an account, take part in walks and activities, earn points and compete with others on the app. They will, however, need to visit each physical phone box to be able to unlock different walks and activities held on the app.
